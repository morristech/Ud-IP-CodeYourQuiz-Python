# PROJECT SPECIFICATION : Code Your Own Quiz

## Game Review
### Game Basics
- Game has 3 or more levels and each level contains 4 or more blanks to fill in

### Beginning the Game
- Immediately after running the program, user is prompted to select a difficulty level from easy / medium / hard
- Once a level is selected, game displays a fill-in-the-blank and a prompt to fill in the first blank.

### Game Play
- When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the previous blank and a new prompt for the next blank
- When player guesses incorrectly, they are prompted to try again


## Code Review

### Use of Variables
- Code uses variables to avoid magic numbers
- Each variable name reflects the purpose of the value stored in it
- Once initiated, the purpose of each variable is maintained throughout the program
- No variables override `Python` built-in values (for example, `def`)

### Use of Functions
- Functions are used as tools to automate tasks which are likely to be repeated
- Functions produce the appropriate output (typically with a return statement) from the appropriate input (function parameters)
- No functions are longer than 18 lines of code (does not include blank lines, comments, or function definitions)

### Appropriate Use of Data
- The appropriate data types are used consistently (strings for text, lists for ordered data, nested lists as appropriate)

### Appropriate Use of Coding Techniques
- Student demonstrates coding techniques like branching and loops appropriately (i.e. to loop through a list, `for element in list:`; or to test whether something is in a list, `if name in list_names:`)

### Comments/Documentation
- Each function includes a comment which explains the intended behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable)


## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
- Let the user decide how many wrong guesses they can make before they lose
